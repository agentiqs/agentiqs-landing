# Introduction to AgentIQS

AgentIQS is a powerful platform for building and managing intelligent agents. This introduction will help you understand the core concepts and get started quickly.

## What is AgentIQS?

AgentIQS provides a comprehensive framework for creating, deploying, and monitoring AI agents. Whether you're building chatbots, automation agents, or complex AI workflows, AgentIQS has the tools you need.

### Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple APIs and SDKs for popular programming languages
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle everything from prototype to production
- **Rich Monitoring**: Comprehensive analytics and debugging tools
- **Flexible Deployment**: Support for cloud, on-premise, and edge deployments

## Core Concepts

### Agents

An agent is an autonomous software entity that can perceive its environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. In AgentIQS, agents are:

- **Configurable**: Define behavior through simple configuration
- **Extensible**: Add custom capabilities and integrations
- **Observable**: Monitor performance and behavior in real-time

### Skills

Skills are reusable capabilities that agents can use to perform specific tasks:

```python
from agentiqs import Agent, Skill

class WebSearchSkill(Skill):
    def search(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Implementation here
        pass

agent = Agent()
agent.add_skill(WebSearchSkill())
```

### Workflows

Workflows define complex multi-step processes that agents can execute:

- **Sequential**: Steps execute one after another
- **Parallel**: Multiple steps execute simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Branching logic based on conditions
- **Loops**: Repeat steps until conditions are met

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** for an AgentIQS account
2. **Install** the SDK for your preferred language
3. **Create** your first agent
4. **Deploy** and monitor your agent
